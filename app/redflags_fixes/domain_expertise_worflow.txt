To integrate domain expertise into your current AI-powered contract/policy analyzer, you need a workflow that injects legal/HR knowledge into your system at the right stages — before, during, and after LLM processing.

🧠 ✅ Overall Workflow to Integrate Domain Expertise into Your Analyzer
This architecture gives your tool human-like expertise, by combining LLM + rules + retrieval.

🧩 DETAILED BREAKDOWN (Component-wise)
1. 🧾 Text Extraction & Preprocessing
Extract text from PDF using PyMuPDF or pdfplumber

Clean noise (page numbers, headers, footers)

Split into logical clauses/sections using NLP (spaCy, nltk, or regex)

2. 🏷 Clause Detection & Labeling
Use rules + GPT to label chunks:

@Termination

@Payment

@Confidentiality

Helps in structured analysis later

3. 📘 Build Your Domain Knowledge Base (KB)
Content Type	Use Case
📋 Ideal clause templates	Used to compare and detect weaknesses
❌ Red flag examples	Detected using pattern matching
✅ Clause checklist	Used to find missing clauses
🧠 FAQs / regulations	Injected into GPT prompt via RAG

🛠 Store these in:

Markdown / CSV files

JSON

Vector DB (for semantic search)

4. 📦 Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
🧠 Before calling GPT, fetch relevant clause examples, rules, or red flags from the KB.

Example:
python
Copy
Edit
retrieved_info = search_vector_store("Termination Clause Best Practices")
Then insert into GPT prompt:

text
Copy
Edit
Compare the user clause to the ideal template:
Ideal: "Either party may terminate with 30 days’ notice in writing..."
User: "Employer may terminate without prior notice..."
✅ GPT now evaluates in context of best practices = domain-aware output.

5. 🧠 LLM Prompt Engineering with Domain Context
Your GPT prompt can look like:

text
Copy
Edit
You are an HR/legal policy expert.

Here is a contract clause:
"Employee must give notice before resignation."

Here is the standard guideline:
"Employee must provide 30-day written notice."

→ Identify issues, suggest improvements, rate risk, and tag missing elements.
✅ Add context dynamically based on document section.

6. ⚠️ Rule-Based Validation (Optional but Powerful)
Use regex or spaCy to detect:

Vague phrases ("reasonable time", "best effort")

Missing entities (e.g., no dates, names)

Hardcoded business rules (e.g., "Must include arbitration clause")

✅ This acts as a fallback layer to catch what LLM might miss or hallucinate.

7. 📊 Final Structured Output
Each clause should be tagged with:

Section	Status	Risk	Suggestion	Score
Termination	Present	High	No notice period defined	4/10
Payment	Present	Low	Matches best practice	9/10
Confidentiality	Missing	—	Add confidentiality clause	0/10

8. 🖥️ Display in User Interface
Use Streamlit, Flask, or React to show:

Clause-wise breakdown

Summary of findings

Red flags with reasons

Suggested rewrites (from GPT)

Downloadable report (PDF/Word)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries You Can Use
Function	Suggested Tool
PDF Parsing	PyMuPDF, pdfplumber
NLP Clause Splitting	spaCy, nltk
RAG Pipeline	LangChain, LlamaIndex
Vector Store	FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma
LLM API	OpenAI GPT-4o
UI Dashboard	Streamlit, Flask, React
Rule Engine (optional)	Python + Regex or spacy.matcher

✅ Summary: Domain Expertise Integration Workflow
Stage	Purpose
Text Extraction	Convert PDF to structured text
Clause Segmentation	Identify and tag key sections
RAG Retrieval	Bring in domain rules/templates
LLM Summary + Scoring	Context-aware evaluation
Rule-based Check	Hard logic for red flags & risks
UI Feedback Layer	Clear, visual breakdown of results


✅ How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. 🔍 Split the document into clauses/sections
For example:

Clause 1: Termination

Clause 2: Payment Terms

Clause 3: Dispute Resolution

...

2. 📚 Retrieve matching domain knowledge for each clause
Use semantic search (embeddings + vector DB) to pull:

Best practice for Termination clause

Red flags associated with Termination

Checklist items or legal standards for that clause

3. 📥 Inject RAG output into prompt for that clause
Prompt example:

text
Copy
Edit
You are a contract reviewer.

User clause:
"The employer may terminate the agreement without notice."

Retrieved best practice:
"Either party may terminate the agreement with 30-day written notice."

Red flag pattern:
"Termination without notice" — flagged as unfair in HR contracts.

→ Evaluate the clause for risk, compliance, and suggest improvement.
4. 🧠 Run this per clause, then aggregate the feedback in your UI.
🎯 Why This is the Best Practice:
Benefit	Explanation
🎯 Focused evaluation	LLM understands clause context clearly
🔍 Fine-grained analysis	Allows clause-level scoring/flagging
🧠 Domain-aware output	Because you feed relevant standards
📊 Better UI experience	Clause-by-clause feedback for the user

🛠 Quick Example (Pseudo-code):
python
Copy
Edit
for clause in split_document(document_text):
    clause_type = classify_clause(clause)  # e.g., Termination
    retrieved_docs = vector_search(clause_type)
    prompt = build_prompt(clause, retrieved_docs)
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(prompt)
    display(response)
📌 Optional Enhancements
Use tags or labels (@Termination, @Confidentiality) to improve retrieval targeting.

Add rule-based triggers before/after GPT for edge cases.

Cache previous GPT outputs for performance.
